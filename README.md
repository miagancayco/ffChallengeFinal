## How to Run

### kNN algorithm

The command to run kNN algorithm on the terminal is python kNNClassifyFF.py

The background.csv file which contains both the training and test data was too large to upload uncompressed to our git repository (163 MB unzipped).
In order to run the kNN then, you must first unzip the background.csv.zip file and have it available in the ffChallengeFinal folder.

The recordResults method does all of this for every child in test data.
